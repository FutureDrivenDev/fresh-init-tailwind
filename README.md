# fresh-init-tailwind

This is an example adding the tw `shim` to rendering, so that the vanilla tailwind syntax (and all examples from the internet) just works.

Also, this uses `tailwind.config.js` to manage themes, so the VSCode Tailwind plugin picks up on your colors.


### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
